Developers: AichiLee (Yang LI), Paul WIECKI, Xingbo ZHAO

Pincipal Investigator: James P. Vary

Basis Light-Front Quantum Chromodynamics (BLFQCD) is a subproject of Basis Light-Front Quantized Field Theory (BLFQ). 
BLFQ is a non-perturbative Quantum Field Theory (QFT). It belongs to Hamiltonian QFT and Light-Front QFT. The basis 
idea of BLFQ, is to used AdS/QCD basis to expand the finite truncated Hilbert space.
